# Overview

In this app I wanted to go over the basic skills to create a flappy bird type game using Python.  My ultimate intention
is to use this code to then create an iOS application in the next couple of weeks.  I also wanted to do coding that required logic
and freshen up on my logical skills.  This project allowed me the opportunity to do all of that.

Here is a link to my Youtube demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code:

# Future Work

Here is a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future:
* I'd like to add more sound effects for flying and for pressing the restart button.
* I'd like to play around with the images and have the game look visually different.
* I'd like to expand into an expert level and give the bird shooting abilities and more obstacles.
